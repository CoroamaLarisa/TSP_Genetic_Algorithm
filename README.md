# TSP_Genetic_Algorithm
Using a genetic algorithm to solve the travelling salesman problem.

Problem statement: A project manager must reach a discussion with a potential client. His agenda is very busy, with a lot of meetings. Being in a time crisis, he wants to get on the shortest route to the customer's destination. Based on the address he has, the iMap application offers several routes where he can reach his destination, each route being marked with an estimated travel time. Determine the shortest route to reach the customer. Requirements:

Identify the shortest route that leaves a location, visit all locations and returns to the starting location.
Identify the shortest route that starts from one location (source) and arrives at another location (destination). It will try to use the same algorithm for both requirements, but parameterized accordingly.
